BUGS:
=====

* Pause the game when you just lose, when the ball shows up it's on top of the canvas... (wrong z values)
* Sometimes ti bounces twice when it shouldn't
* Unneeded resizes and repaints on startup
* Sometimes when getting split ball with a ball attached to the bar (after add ball, I think not split ball) strange things happen...


TODO:
=====

== Short Term ==
* Item: 
    - don't use inheritance
* Ask confirmation on close if a game is running
* Restrucure file hirarchy
* Put constants used only in one place out of globals.h 
* use m_ for all data members
* add points for each remaining hidden brick when going to the next level..

== Mid Term ==
* Add gui to load new levesets
* Add sound

* Profiling

== Long Term ==
* Level editor
* Add a border (?)
* Add gifts to be able to shoot at the bricks (?)
* Full screen mode
