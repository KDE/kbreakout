BUGS:
=====

* Pause the game when you just lose, when the ball shows up it's on top of the canvas... (wrong z values)
* Sometimes ti bounces twice when it shouldn't
* Unneeded resizes and repaints on startup


TODO:
=====

== Short Term ==
* Check the speed increase is applied only one for each step, non for each ball
* Add score when game won (and maybe additional score for the lives)
* Item: 
    - don't use inheritance
* Ask confirmation on close if a game is running
* Put constants used only in one place out of globals.h 
* use m_ for all data members

== Mid Term ==
* Try to port to QGraphicsScene
* Add gui to load new levesets
* Add sounds
* Add nice visual effects
* Profiling

== Long Term ==
* Level editor
* Add a border (?)
* Add gifts to be able to shoot at the bricks (?)
* Full screen mode
  - mouse sensibility option (when in full screen mode)
  - screen resolution option (when in full screen mode)
* Add demo mode with AI playing
* Add optional use of openGL
